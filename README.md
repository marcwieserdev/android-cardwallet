# android-cardwallet

Right now this app is a simple workaround to avoid the french invasive app "TousAntiCovid".
The reason to avoid using it was simple : The app asks for your GPS location without giving you the chance to disable
the features using it.

This is why this app is a simple barcode scanner, which stores any barcode locally. **No data is transiting over a network, and this won't change**

The future of this app is to transform it into a simple barcode wallet, as our future may be to have more and more digital fidelity card, sanitary passes, museum pass, event tickets, etc... And having one app for each merchant will be quickly really annoying.

In order to be clean and fully tested, the card wallet will be a start over, inspired by the "PassSanitaire" app, which you can found in the legacy folder.
